# How to use it

In java directory there's a working version that will read transactions by driving a browser and screen scraping pages. You will see the browser as it goes from page to page.

I've never finished it - started working on Cocoa version but since it has such a low priority and I have already a working Java version it will take time until I make it a real app.

So grab it and adapt to your needs.
